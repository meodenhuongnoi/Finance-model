I collected data of 10 Vietnamese stocks from 2020-2024, 5 from large-cap firms and 5 from mid-cap ones. 
I specially picked 5 of those which have positive monthly average return to construct EF model.
I process the data in the 'dataprocessing' notebook.
The 'efmodelling' notebook is where the model constructed.
